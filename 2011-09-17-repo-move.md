When you did your last pull you may have seen something like:

    $ git pull
    warning: no common commits
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    From github.com:mcviz/repo
     * [new branch]      repo_moved_see_mcviz.net/2011-09-17-repo-move -> gh/repo_moved_see_mcviz.net/2011-09-17-repo-move
    You asked to pull from the remote 'gh', but did not specify
    a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
    for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.

This happened because we renamed the repository from "repo" to "mcviz".

You need to do the following:

* Look in your plaintext `mcviz/.git/config` file
* Find lines that look like this:

    url = git@github.com:mcviz/repo.git

(or git://github.com/mcviz/repo.git or https://github.com/mcviz/repo.git)

and change `repo` to `mcviz`, i.e:

    url = git@github.com:mcviz/mcviz.git
    
Then you will also want to prune the repo_moved branch with 

    $ git remote prune origin
